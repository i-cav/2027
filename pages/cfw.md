## Workshop Proposals

Proposals will be reviewed by the Workshop Chair, CAV 2027 Program Chairs, and members of the CAV Steering Committee; see the [organization page]({{ "/organization/" | relative_url }}) for the full list.

Proposals must consist of the following two parts:

### Part I: Technical Information

A short (approximately one page) justification of the proposed topic, its significance and relevance to CAV, and the particular benefits of the workshop to the verification community, as well as its connection to related workshops at CAV and beyond.

### Part II: Organizational Information

- Contact information of the workshop organizers
- Primary contact (Workshop Chair)
- Desired length of the workshop (one or two days)
- Estimated audience size, along with a brief justification
- Proposed format and agenda (e.g., demo sessions or tutorials)
- Potential invited speakers
- Procedures for selecting papers and participants
- Plans for dissemination, if any (e.g., special issues of journals)
- Special technical or AV requirements
- Links to a preliminary website of the workshop and call for papers (if possible)
- Information on whether the workshop has been previously held

### Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- Potential to advance the state of the art in verification technologies
- Potential to break new ground and create bridges with other disciplines
- Relevance to CAV
- Degree of overlap with other proposed workshops
- Past successes of the workshop and association with previous CAV conferences
- Organizers' ability and experience to lead a successful workshop
